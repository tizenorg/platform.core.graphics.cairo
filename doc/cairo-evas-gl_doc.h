 * @brief  Cairo GL/Evas_GL APIs are offical APIs for Tizen.
 * @ingroup OPENSRC_CAIRO_FRAMEWORK
 *
 * @section CAIRO_EVAS_GL Required Header
 *   \#include <cairo-evas-gl.h>
 *
 * @section CAIRO_EVAS_GL_MODULE_OVERVIEW Overview
 * In Tizen, Cairo provides gl backend in order to do hardware-accelerated rendering.
 * Since the EGL is not public supported in Tizen, Cairo Evas_GL has been provided to user interfaces instead to allow indirect access to EGL layer.
 *
 * Features	:\n
 *	- Support a new cairo_device structure for interface to the underlying GL or EvasGL.\n
 *	- Support a new cairo_surface structure for representing GL or Evas_GL_Surface object that cairo can render to.\n
 *	- Get the underlying Evas_GL object used to create cairo device object.\n
 *	- Get the underlying Evas_GL_Context object used to create cairo device object.
 *
 * Remarks	:\n
 *	- Cairo GL and Cairo Evas_GL will use an GL/Evas_GL context and API set.\n
 *	- Therefore, Evas_GL and OpenGL-ES should be provided for normal operation of Cairo gl backend.\n
